      # Finding the commit range is not as trivial as it may seem.
      #
      # At this stage, git's HEAD does not refer to the latest commit in the
      # PR, but rather to the merge commit inserted by the PR. So instead we
      # have to get 'HEAD' from the PR event.
      #
      # One cannot use the number of commits
      # (github.event.pull_request.commits) to find the start commit
      # i.e. HEAD~N does not work, this breaks if there are merge commits.
